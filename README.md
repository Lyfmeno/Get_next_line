Get next line Project :
=======================

Welcome to the GNL project !

The goal of GNL is to returns a line read from a file descriptor.

Project Description
-------------------

You must create a function that will return a file line by line:

*   Make sure that your function works as expected both when reading a file and when reading from the standard input.
*   The returned line should include the terminating '\\n'.
*   A good start would be to know what a static variable is.

Project Requirements
--------------------

*   Because you will have to read files in get\_next\_line(), add this option to your compiler call: -D BUFFER\_SIZE=n.
*   lseek() is forbidden.
*   Global variables are forbidden.
