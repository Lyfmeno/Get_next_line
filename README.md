  <h1>Get next line Project :</a></h1>
  <p>Welcome to the GNL project !</p>
  <p>The goal of GNL is to returns a line read from a file descriptor.</p>
  
  <h2>Project Description</h2>
  <p>You must create a function that will return a file line by line:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Make sure that your function works as expected both when reading a file and when reading from the standard input.</li>
    <li>The returned line should include the terminating '\n'.</li>
    <li>A good start would be to know what a static variable is.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Project Requirements</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Because you will have to read files in get_next_line(), add this option to your compiler call: -D BUFFER_SIZE=n.</li>
    <li>lseek() is forbidden.</li>
    <li>Global variables are forbidden.</li>
  </ul>
